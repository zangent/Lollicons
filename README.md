Yosemite Icons
==================

A Linux icon theme to match Yosemite

Meticulously hand-crafted in Inkscape :)

Make sure to download and install the [Numix Circle](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-circle "Numix Circle Repository") icon pack first, because there aren't many icons in this pack currently, and the icons in Numix Circle aren't as jarring as having a default gnome icon staring you in the face.  Ugh.

If you don't see an icon in amazing Yosemite style, just start an issue and I should take care of it quickly.

Install
=========

Paste the following commands in your favorite terminal:

    sudo sh -c "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer/master/fix.sh | bash"

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacpier/lollicons/master/download_from_github.sh | sh


[Hardcode Fixer](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer ""Hardcode-Fixer" by Foggalong") requires sudo in order to fix launcher entries that have hardcoded icons.  If you aren't comfortable with giving a random script sudo access, just run it without sudo.  It will still fix icons in the home folder.


Some programs aren't included in Hardcode Fixer.

 * Slingscold:

   Run in your favorite terminal: sudo gedit /usr/share/applications/slingscold.desktop

   Replace "/usr/share/icons/slingscold.png" with "slingscold"
